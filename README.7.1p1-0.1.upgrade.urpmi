As of 7.1p1-0.1, Support for ssh-dss, ssh-dss-cert-*
host and userkeys is disabled by upstream
(but we are not following this for now)by default at run-time.
These may be re-enabled using the instructions
at http://www.openssh.com/legacy.html

If you want to enable this please add to:

ssh_config:
PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes=+ssh-dss

sshd_config:
HostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-dss
